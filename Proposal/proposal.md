###Controversy Utility - _(Custom Project)_
#### 1. Background

In public discussions running over longer periods of time, it often
happens that some participants significantly change their opinions on
the subject.
A popular example, is the reactor explosion in Fukushima, totally
turning around the plans of the german government concerning the future
of nuclear power plants.
Moreover, it often happens that members of the same interest group have
contradicting views. For instance, certain members of the german party
SPD called for a fast implementation of the concept of
"Vorratsdatenspeicherung" after the attacks on the french satirical
magazine "Charlie Hebdo" (January 2015), while other members strongly
object to this idea.

Such changes are usually difficult to keep track of as an individual,
because media covers only the last few weeks of events.
It would be nice to have a platform, which makes it easy to document
contradictions or changes happening in the opinion of politicians or
other public entities, allowing to measure characteristics like
*trustworthyness* or *consistency of opinions* as well as *linking
specific events to changes of opinion*.

#### 2. Project Idea

The idea is to design a web platform, which allows to select statements of
public entities from different sources (e.g. a part of a YouTube video,
a quote in a news article or magazine, wiki entry etc.) and to relate
them with one another in a meaningful way.
This can be done by unexperienced users in a graphical user interface.
The steps may be as follows:

1.  The user specifies the question of the discussion. He can choose from
    existing questions or add a new one (works similar to tagging in
    Twitter).
2.  The user selects statements of one or more persons to the question.
3.  The user enters relationships between those statements, such as
    - *contradiction:* statement contradicts either
        * prior statements of the same person or
        * statements of members of the same interest group (e.g. political party or
        * a well known fact (referenced by a reliable source)

    - *answer:* statement answers another statement (maybe of another
      person)
    - *criticizes:* statement critizes statement of another person
    - *etc.*

By use of a database different filters on the data are possible, e.g.

###Network Manager - _(Custom Project)_
#### 1. Background

Computer networking is difficult and even though the Linux kernel, device
drivers and additional modules like the wpa\_supplicant already offer some kind 
of "high level" abstract interface, most users will be bugged
by manually configuring even the simplest kinds of (wireless) networks.
This is where a network manager comes in handy - a user friendly utility
to keep track of the various configurations and settings needed so that
even techically unaware personnel is enabled to set up and administer
network devices.
 
#### 2. Project Idea

The scope of this project can easily be altered with regard to the intended 
functionality. 

##### Minimal Functionality
The bare minimum for a network manager is a command line utility to administer 
the interfaces found in `/sys/class/net`. This includes the possibilities to 
create, alter, (de-)activate and delete profiles for each network the user wants
to connect to.

##### Possible Functionality
1. Listing accessibe WLAN APs [cf. iwlist(8)] and LAN connections directly in
   the utility.
2. Declaring network families, e.g. based on a common SSID in order to easily
   share login information among APs in large scaled networks (e.g. Uni KN).
3. Splitting the functionality in a daemon- and client module, connected e.g.
   via D-Bus to get rid of the otherwise needed root privileges.
4. Integrating the daemon module into the init system [cf. systemd(1)],
   in order to activate the network managers' functionality on system boot.
5. Auto detection of more complex authentification methods [cf. RADIUS] while
   offering security optimized profile templates, e.g. forcing CA certificate
   checks and certificate subject matching.
6. Systemwide, granularity-configurable logging functionality [cf. journalctl(1)].
7. GUIs, either terminal based [cf. ncurses] or UI-integrated [cf. GTK+].
8. Usage and traffic stats, graphically represented to the user as diagrams.
9. Logging of detected wireless networks, possibly linked to GPS data 
   [cf. wardriving].
10. Management of other networking-related wireless modules, e.g. Bluetooth.
